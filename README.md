# SEG2105 PROJECT

Service Novigrad is a new app for the residents of Novigrad to enquire about the services offered by the province. Service Novigrad Branches/Employees can offer various services to the citizens from a list of services provided by an Admin. Services such as driver's license, health card and photo ID are offered. Customers/Users can browse the offered services, and search for a Service Novigrad branch by name, rating, time availability, and address. 
The application was coded in Java as well as XML using Android Studio. The built-in emulator, numerous unit test cases, as well as CircleCI were used to test the application. The application utilizes Firebase integration. Each service and userâ€™s data are held in Firebase Realtime Database, hence, the application requires an internet connection to access said information.
Coding this application has given me some experience in a range of different technologies used in the field, such as and not limited to: GitHub, continuous integration, implementation of different features, releasing updates, as well as effective troubleshooting.
